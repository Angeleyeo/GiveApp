## A.  Overview


### Target Audience: 

Singaporeans

### Motivation:

Want to spread kindness, but don’t know where to start? 

Research has shown that Singapore residents are less gracious than they had ever been in the last five years. Fewer people were experiencing acts of graciousness, whether receiving or simply witnessing a kind act. Reasons being: People are too busy, the kindness movement has a lack of relevance, not engaging enough. Many want to be able to give within their capabilities and in new & interesting ways, instead of traditional volunteering and donating which often comprises inflexible volunteering schedules and suggested amounts of monetary donations. 

We want to help make kindness easy. Simply by going on your daily run, or challenging your friends, you can help to raise funds for charity! For a special group of people - f&b owners, the leftovers usually resulting in food waste can be a necessity some need to survive, and we will make this possible. Give, within your own means. Kindness made easy.

As easy as 1, 2, 3!
	
### Aim: 
We hope to facilitate the spread of kindness in Singapore.	
#### User Stories:
- As someone who has limited free time, I want to be able to give in ways that I can incorporate into my daily schedule so that I can give back to society on a regular basis during pockets of free time. 
- As someone who does not have the means to donate, I want to be able to give in a different way so that I can give back to society in alternative forms within my means aside from monetary donations.
- As someone who finds the current kindness movement uninteresting, I want to be able to give in fun ways along with friends so that giving becomes more engaging which helps motivate me to give. 

#### Scope of project: 
An Android Application with 3 different features which help make the spread of kindness easy. Firstly, ‘run for one’ whereby $1 is given to their local charities of choice for every 10000 steps logged. Secondly, ‘Meal Thrills’ where f&b owners sell their leftover items at slashed prices / give them away for free to anyone who might need it. Lastly, ‘iCU!’ (I challenge you) whereby friends can challenge each other to complete challenges to raise awareness for societal groups in need. Give will be supported by a database server storing relevant information.
‘Run for one’ aims to make giving more convenient by allowing users to give in their daily life - exercising. For every 10000 steps the user runs and clocks, $1 will be donated to his beneficiary of choice by the companies we will be partnering with.


‘iCU!’ - i challenge you, targets the stigma behind charity works in Singapore and hopes to create a community where friends and families can give through interesting challenges that help spread awareness for social causes as well. Users can send their friends mini challenges to complete and if they fail, they would donate $0.10 to a beneficiary of choice.


‘Meal thrills’ aims to target the reduction of food waste in Singapore by providing a platform where merchants can sell their food at low to zero cost price.
